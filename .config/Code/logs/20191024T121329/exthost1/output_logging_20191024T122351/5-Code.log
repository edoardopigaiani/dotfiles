Hello, Edoardo Pigaiani!
My favourite language is Python!
In Python we can use single and double quotes.
This is an example of using single quotes:

One of Python's strenghts is its diverse community.
And this is an example of using double quotes:

If you use single quotes as delimiter you can put "double quotes" inside.

In Python you can also use numbers:	
when you divide any two numbers if they are integers that result in a whole number, 	
you'll always get a float.	
This is an example of a list:
['morning', 'afternoon', 'evening']
