Hello, Edoardo Pigaiani!
My favourite language is Python!
In Python we can use single and double quotes.
This is an example of using single quotes:

One of Python's strenghts is its diverse community.
And this is an example of using double quotes:

If you use single quotes as delimiter you can put "double quotes" inside.

In Python you can also use numbers:	
when you divide any two numbers if they are integers that result in a whole number, 	
you'll always get a float.	
This is an example of a list:
['Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Night']

This is how you pick only one element form a list and print it:

Morning

This is how you use string methods in lists:

MORNING
You can also pick multiple elements from a list:

Morning
Afternoon
Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By ask-ing for the item at index -1 , Python always returns the last item in the list:
Night
A day is divided between four parts, it is currently Morning

Hello, Edoardo Pigaiani!
My favourite language is Python!
In Python we can use single and double quotes.
This is an example of using single quotes:

One of Python's strenghts is its diverse community.
And this is an example of using double quotes:

If you use single quotes as delimiter you can put "double quotes" inside.

In Python you can also use numbers:	
when you divide any two numbers if they are integers that result in a whole number, 	
you'll always get a float.	
This is an example of a list:
['Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Night']

This is how you pick only one element form a list and print it:

Morning

This is how you use string methods in lists:

MORNING
You can also pick multiple elements from a list:

Morning
Afternoon
Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By ask-ing for the item at index -1 , Python always returns the last item in the list:
Night
A day is divided between four parts, it is currently Morning

Hello, Edoardo Pigaiani!
My favourite language is Python!
In Python we can use single and double quotes.
This is an example of using single quotes:

One of Python's strenghts is its diverse community.
And this is an example of using double quotes:

If you use single quotes as delimiter you can put "double quotes" inside.

In Python you can also use numbers:	
when you divide any two numbers if they are integers that result in a whole number, 	
you'll always get a float.	
This is an example of a list:
['Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening', 'Night']

This is how you pick only one element form a list and print it:

Morning

This is how you use string methods in lists:

MORNING
You can also pick multiple elements from a list:

Morning
Afternoon
Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By ask-ing for the item at index -1 , Python always returns the last item in the list:
Night
A day is divided between four parts, it is currently Morning
